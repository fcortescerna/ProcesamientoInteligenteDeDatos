The conflict is caused by:
    The user requested keras~=3.8.0
    google-ml-edu 0.1.2 depends on keras
    tensorflow 2.20.0 depends on keras>=3.10.0

Additionally, some packages in these conflicts have no matching distributions available for your environment:
    keras

To fix this you could try to:
1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
